# 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap

Repository containing projects developed by Juan Esteban Correa Pérez as part of the Web Stack specialization program at Holberton School.

In this project, you will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
